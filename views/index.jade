          p 
            a(href='http://soundcloud.com', target='_blank') Soundcloud 
            | is my favorite web site. It's the main avenue I have for finding new music. I use it everyday. I particularly love the feature to comment on the timeline as a song is playing. Finally, I can communicate with my favorite artists! I came to notice, in densely commented songs, some comments are easily missed. It also seemed to be the case that popular artists or songs would attract lots of spam or troll comments. I began to wonder if many artists even bother to read the comments anymore, since the info there may or may not be what they're looking for. I still think Soundcloud's commenting system is brilliant and necessary. Soundmap humbly suggests a layer on top of that, stripping away the words and getting to the core sentiment of liking a specific point in a song.

            | Soundmap was built as a personal project in a little over 2 weeks by me, 
            a(href='http://dinomiike.github.io', target='_blank') Miike Ramos. 
            | I made it because of my fondness for music. I have a hunch that when you're listening to a song, there's a point where it goes from being just another song to being a song you love. I want to hightlight that point and celebrate the parts everyone likes together.
          p
            | My dream: for a musician to come to Soundmap and see the heat map for one of their songs and instantly understand the specific quality that makes their music loved. This project is a work-in-progress. I plan to publish new features and improvements that make it useful and fun for fans and musicians alike. If you're a musician and interested in getting a more detailed report on the data I'm collecting, holler at me on Twitter
